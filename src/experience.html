                Developing HTML5/JavaScript games for the gambling industry, predominantly slot and table games. Alongside my development responsibilities I also led initiatives to improve development processes at the company.
                The first of these was the automation of game builds within our development tools, this eliminated mistakes that occurred frequently due the need for manual edits to build files before submissions.
                Secondly I pushed to make pull requests (change control) a standard for all framework and games development, helping to reduce the risk of errors being inadvertently introduced.
                Thirdly, I championed the introduction of a centralised knowledge base for game developers, serving as its architect and sole administrator.
